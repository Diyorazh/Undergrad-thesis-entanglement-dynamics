# Undergrad-thesis-entanglement-dynamics
undergraduate thesis, simulations of entanglement dynamics and literature review by Jinsu Zhang, Tsinghua University.

Simulated quantities (Entanglement Entropy, Mutual Information, etc.) to reproduce Entanglement Transition in Random Unitary Circuit.

Thesis was written in Chinese and Slides in English.

I am glad to provide code and algorithms. The pseudocode was written in my thesis but I also added markdown blocks in my jupyter notebook. If you used my code in your academic work, please cite the github link. 

You are always welcome to point out any mistakes in my thesis by "issues". Thank you!
